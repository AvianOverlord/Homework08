GWU Bootcamp homework - Classes

Pseduocode:
-Create an HTML document to contain all the elements.
    -Write in ./Output
-Create a CSS file (On my own, or in the code), then attach a link and classes into the HTML
-Nested functions to create the HTML elements. Feed in classes, content, links, etc.

-Multiple inquirer functions, with navigation between them
    -Set of generic questions, which each uses, along with a specific set
    -Start: Starting questions (ask about style to get fancy), team name, etc.
    -Manager, Employee, and Intern have their seperate questions, create object of the approaiate class
    -When creator is finished, start new menu function.
        -Allows for adding a new intern, adding a new enginner, seeing who has already been added, deleting excess, and finishing
        -Last calls the HTML writer.

-Staff Array
    -Each creator adds to it.
    -When adding enginners, if there are interns, put engis in front. Possible to do this by sorting. Perhaps a number attached to the three classes.

-Writer:
    -Creates a container and card for each entry in the staff array (Or however I end up doing it);
    -Uses the team name as a the page title, top header, and file name.
    -Readme suggests "HTML templates." Perhaps some of the HTML could be stored on the classes of the various employees.
